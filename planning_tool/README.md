Reflection:
Overall I think the main building blocks for this application are there. The client side, server side and SQL functions all work together to perform the tasks that are on this application, 
however upon reflection I realise I spent too much time on the HTML and CSS side and the functionality of this application has suffered as a consequence. 
If I were to do this piece of coursework again in the future I would definitely start earlier. The reason being is I didn't quite know the extent of this task until it was too late. This has caused a great deal of frustration as I know I can do it, just not that fast!
